## Huffman Coding

Using Huffman coding, this program encodes input files into a compressed form, and decompresses those files using a decoder. The decoder only works on compressed files that were encoded by this programâ€™s encoder and nothing else. 

## Building

Running either of the following commands below builds the encoder and the decoder:
```
$ make
```
```
$ make all
```
To only build the encoder, run this following command:
```
$ make encode
```
To only build the decoder, run this following command:
```
$ make decode
```

## Running

The encoder and decoder both accept different types of command line options. Below are the specifics in running the encoder and the decoder, respectively.


Running the encoder:
```
$ ./encode 
```

Command line options:
```
-h              (display program and help usage)

-v              (print compression statistics)

-i infile       (specify the input file to compress)

-o outfile	(specify the output of the compressed data)
```

Running the decoder:
```
$ ./decode
```

Command line options:
```
-h              (display program and help usage)

-v              (print compression statistics)

-i infile       (specify the input file to decompress)

-o outfile	(specify the output of the decompressed data)
```
